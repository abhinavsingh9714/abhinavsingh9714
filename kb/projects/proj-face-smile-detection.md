# Face and Smile Detection (Personal, Sep–Oct 2017)

**What:** Real-time detection of facial features (eyes, smile) in video.

## What was built

- Detected faces, eyes, and smiles using the Viola-Jones algorithm
- OpenCV Haar cascades: facehaarcascade, eyehaarcascade, smilehaarcascade
- Real-time video processing pipeline

Early computer vision project (2017) — one of the first ML/AI explorations. Used classical CV (Haar cascades / Viola-Jones) before deep learning became the dominant approach. Demonstrates long-standing interest in computer vision that continued with YOLOv8, Detectron2, and CLIP work.
