# Autonomous Buggy (Personal, Jan–May 2017)

**What:** Autonomous robot with sensor-based obstacle avoidance and wireless communication.

## What was built

- Arduino ATmega328-based autonomous buggy
- Sensors: Xbee (wireless), UV sensor, ultrasonic (obstacle detection)
- L293D motor driver for motor control
- Features: obstacle avoidance, wireless inter-buggy communication, automatic speed variation

Early hardware/embedded systems project from the B.E. years — demonstrates hands-on embedded engineering that continued at Exicom (OCPP EV charger) and informs current understanding of systems with real-world physical constraints.
