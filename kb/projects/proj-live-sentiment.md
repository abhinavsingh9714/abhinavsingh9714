- Ensemble of 7 ML classifiers (majority voting) for robust sentiment prediction
- NLTK for text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Twitter Streaming API for real-time tweet ingestion

## Technical note
Built in 2018 as an early NLP project before the deep learning era of sentiment analysis. Demonstrates early interest in real-time data pipelines, ensemble methods, and live visualization — themes that continued throughout the career.
