# Quantum ML Researcher — Do Quantum (Mar 2025 – Present)

**Focus:** Redesigning classical ML algorithms for quantum hardware.

**What was done:**
- Led the redesign of classical ML algorithms (e.g., optimization routines, kernel methods) for quantum hardware
- Implemented ML workflows adapted for quantum computers
- Performed benchmarking to assess scalability and limitations of quantum ML approaches
- Driving innovation by evaluating where quantum speedup is genuinely achievable vs. classical ML

This is a research-focused role exploring the frontier of quantum-classical hybrid ML systems, running alongside the TAAI Labs engineering role.
