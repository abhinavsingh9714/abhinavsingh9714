# Graduate Engineering Trainee — Exicom (Jan 2019 – Sep 2019)

**Project:** EV charger integration with central server using OCPP protocol.

## What was built

- **Embedded system** integrating EV chargers with a central server using the OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol)
- **Finite state machine** to manage EV charger operational states (available, preparing, charging, suspended, finishing, reserved, faulted) — enables real-time status updates and transparent notifications
- **CI/CD pipeline** — ensured smooth firmware updates under real-world challenges: internet interruptions and power outages

## Scale
- System serves 21,000+ users across India and South Asia

## Key technical note
OCPP is a standardized communication protocol between EV charging stations and a central management system. Implementing it correctly requires handling state transitions, message queuing for unreliable network conditions, and strict protocol conformance.
