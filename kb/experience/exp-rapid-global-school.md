**Project:** Student management system for 2,000+ students.

## What was built

- **RESTful API** using Java Spring Boot — managed student profiles, academic records, and attendance
- **PostgreSQL database** — schema designed for student data, class records, and attendance tracking
- **Automated CI/CD pipeline** — reduced deployment time and errors, enabling faster feature rollouts

## Impact
- Eliminated manual data management overhead for 2,000+ student records
- CI/CD pipeline improved system reliability and reduced deployment friction

This role represents the enterprise software engineering foundation before the transition to ML/AI. It established core practices: API design, relational database management, CI/CD, and production software lifecycle.
