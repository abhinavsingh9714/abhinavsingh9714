# Java and Spring Boot

Used for backend REST API development at Rapid Global School.

**Where used:**
- **Rapid Global School (Oct 2019–Jul 2021)** — Designed and built a RESTful API using Java Spring Boot to manage student profiles, academic records, and attendance for 2,000+ students. Used PostgreSQL as the database. Established an automated CI/CD pipeline alongside the Spring Boot service, reducing deployment time and errors and enabling faster feature rollouts.
- **Early personal projects** — Built an Android application for Har Hath Kalam Foundation in Java and a live eLearning streaming service.

Java / Spring Boot represents the enterprise backend engineering background before the career pivot to ML/AI. It provided the foundation for understanding REST API design, database integration, CI/CD, and production software lifecycle management.
