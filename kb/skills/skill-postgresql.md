# PostgreSQL

Used as the relational database backend for the student management system.

**Where used:**
- **Rapid Global School (Oct 2019–Jul 2021)** — PostgreSQL database for managing student profiles, academic records, and attendance for 2,000+ students. Integrated with a Java Spring Boot REST API. Designed the schema for student data, class records, and attendance tracking. The system reduced manual data management overhead significantly.

PostgreSQL was chosen for its robustness, strong SQL compliance, and good performance for structured relational data. It paired well with Spring Boot's JPA/Hibernate ORM for entity management.
