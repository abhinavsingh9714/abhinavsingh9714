# CI/CD

Practiced as standard MLOps and DevOps methodology across multiple roles.

**Where used:**
- **Rapid Global School (Oct 2019–Jul 2021)** — Established an automated CI/CD pipeline for the Java Spring Boot student management API. Reduced deployment time and errors, enabling faster and more reliable feature rollouts.
- **Exicom (Jan–Sep 2019)** — Contributed to a CI/CD pipeline for EV charger firmware updates. Ensured smooth, consistent software updates under real-world challenges like internet interruptions and power outages.
- **KradleJoy (Apr–Aug 2024)** — Containerized FastAPI ML pipeline with Docker and deployed on AWS EC2. Docker + EC2 deployment follows modern CI/CD principles (reproducible builds, environment parity).
- **TAAI Labs (Aug 2025–Present)** — Full AWS infrastructure for production knowledge ingestion (Lambda + Step Functions). Structured logging and environment-based config used throughout.

CI/CD is applied as a standard engineering practice — not just in software, but also for ML model deployments where reproducibility and rollback capability matter.
