# Python

Primary programming language across all of Abhinav's ML and backend work. Used in every project from 2017 onwards.

**Where used:**
- PyTorch training scripts for all custom model training (Slo-Mo U-Net, LSTM, plant disease CNN, KradleJoy YOLOv8 fine-tuning)
- FastAPI services at KradleJoy (baby monitoring) and freelance (sentiment analysis, visual search)
- LangChain and LangGraph agent pipelines (EdTech TULNA multi-agent system, Jira Backlog Generator, TAAI Labs Neuron)
- scikit-learn and XGBoost pipelines for classical ML (MDI churn prediction, IISc classification projects)
- PySpark jobs for large-scale tweet preprocessing (IISc and freelance)
- Data preprocessing and EDA for every data science project
- Build scripts (build_kb_index.ts equivalent logic was prototyped in Python; all KB tooling)
- OpenAI API usage in both the portfolio site and Neuron

Python is the default choice for everything ML, data, and backend.
