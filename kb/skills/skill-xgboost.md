# XGBoost

Used for tabular ML tasks as a strong gradient boosting baseline.

**Where used:**
- **MDI Research (Jan–Jul 2024)** — Applied XGBoost for customer churn prediction models and dynamic pricing strategies as part of AI-driven CRM research at Management Development Institute, Gurgaon. XGBoost was used alongside other ensemble methods as the go-to baseline for structured/tabular data problems, where tree-based models typically outperform neural approaches.
- Contributed to a published book on AI-driven CRM where XGBoost-based models demonstrated AI's role in customer engagement and revenue optimization.

XGBoost is the first-choice model for any structured/tabular classification or regression task before considering deep learning, due to its strong performance on real-world tabular data, built-in feature importance, and training speed.
